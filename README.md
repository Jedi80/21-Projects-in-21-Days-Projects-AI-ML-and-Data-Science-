# 21-Projects-in-21-Days-Projects-AI-ML-and-Data-Science-
This is a group of projects I worked on in a GeeksforGeeks class on AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
You will need to open these projects in Google Colab for them to work.

***For GeeksforGeeks***
Each folder has the Google Colab project from your lecture. My part is at the bottom of each notebook/ipynb file. Any photos or files you'd like submitted in addition to the code project are in their corresponding folders, in addition to other files I used.
